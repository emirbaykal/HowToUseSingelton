## HOW TO USE SINGELTON

-An “ObjectSpawner” game object is created.

-We make the Game Object containing the class we want to use as a singleton into a prefab.

-We assign this to the “persistentObjectPrefab” inside the “ObjectSpawner”.

-Now we can use it as a singleton.

!If desired, we can also convert this into a system with multiple singletons.
